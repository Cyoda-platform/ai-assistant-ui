## üéØ Project Overview

### What We're Building
A comprehensive workflow management system that enables users to visually design, edit, and manage state machine workflows through an intuitive canvas-based interface in the web application.

### Why It Matters
- **Business Value**: Enables non-technical users to design complex business process automation
- **User Experience**: Visual workflow design is more intuitive than code-based configuration
- **Productivity**: Reduces workflow creation time from hours to minutes
- **Portability**: Import/export enables workflow sharing and backup

### Key Deliverables
1. Visual workflow canvas with drag-and-drop capabilities
2. Workflow lifecycle management (create, edit, delete)
3. Import/export functionality for workflow portability
4. Browser-based persistence (no backend required)
5. Schema-compliant workflow validation

## Remaining Tasks for Next Session

### üéØ Immediate Priority (Continue Current Task)

**Task 12: Migrate Monaco Editor Integration** 
- **Status**: 30% complete
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Complete updating `packages/web/src/utils/editorUtils.ts` to use Ant Design modals instead of Element Plus
  2. Create React version of `ChatBotEditorMarkdown` component
  3. Create React version of `ChatBotEditorWorkflow` component  
  4. Update any other components that use the Monaco Editor
  5. Test Monaco Editor integration in React environment

### üìã Remaining Tasks (7 tasks)

**Task 13: Migrate Vue Flow to React Flow** 
- Replace `@vue-flow` components with `@xyflow/react` (React Flow)
- Update workflow visualization components
- Maintain the same functionality for workflow diagrams

**Task 14: Update Styling and SCSS**
- Review and update SCSS files for React compatibility
- Ensure CSS modules or styled-components work properly
- Maintain the existing design system

**Task 15: Migrate Helper Functions and Utilities**
- Update helper functions and utilities to work with React patterns
- Replace Vue-specific utilities with React equivalents
- Update any remaining Vue-specific code

**Task 16: Update Type Definitions**
- Update TypeScript types and interfaces to work with React
- Replace Vue-specific types with React equivalents
- Ensure type safety across the application

**Task 17: Test and Debug Migration**
- Comprehensive testing of the migrated application
- Fix any issues and bugs
- Verify all functionality works as expected
- Performance testing and optimization

**Task 18: Update Documentation and Scripts**
- Update package.json scripts for React
- Update README files and documentation
- Document any changes in architecture or patterns

**Task 19: Final Integration and Testing**
- Complete end-to-end testing
- Final bug fixes and optimizations
- Deployment preparation
- Migration completion verification

## Key Files and Components Status

### ‚úÖ Fully Migrated
- **State Management**: All Zustand stores working
- **Authentication**: Auth0 React integration complete
- **Routing**: React Router with navigation guards
- **Internationalization**: react-i18next setup complete
- **Core Components**: Layouts, AuthState, ConfirmationDialog
- **Chat Components**: ChatBot, ChatBotSubmitForm, message components
- **UI Components**: Ant Design integration complete

### üîÑ Partially Migrated
- **Monaco Editor**: React Editor component created, utilities need completion
- **Views**: Basic React versions created, may need Monaco Editor integration

### ‚ùå Not Yet Migrated
- **Vue Flow Components**: Still using Vue Flow, needs React Flow migration
- **Editor-related Components**: ChatBotEditorMarkdown, ChatBotEditorWorkflow
- **Some Helper Functions**: May have Vue-specific patterns
- **Workflow Visualization**: Depends on Vue Flow migration

## Technical Notes for Next Session

### Monaco Editor Migration
- **Current State**: Basic React Editor component created with proper Monaco setup
- **Key Files**:
  - `packages/web/src/components/Editor/Editor.tsx` (‚úÖ Created)
  - `packages/web/src/utils/editorUtils.ts` (üîÑ Partially updated)
  - `packages/web/src/components/ChatBot/ChatBotEditorMarkdown.vue` (‚ùå Needs React version)
  - `packages/web/src/components/ChatBot/ChatBotEditorWorkflow.vue` (‚ùå Needs React version)

### Build Status
- **Current Build**: ‚úÖ Successful
- **Dependencies**: All React dependencies installed and working
- **Configuration**: Vite, TypeScript, ESLint all configured for React

### Architecture Decisions Made
- **State Management**: Zustand (working well)
- **UI Framework**: Ant Design (successful migration from Element Plus)
- **Routing**: React Router v6 with nested routes
- **Internationalization**: react-i18next with API-based translations
- **Authentication**: @auth0/auth0-react

## Recommended Approach for Next Session

1. **Start with Monaco Editor completion** (highest priority)
2. **Focus on one component at a time** to maintain build stability
3. **Test each component** after migration before moving to next
4. **Keep build passing** throughout the process
5. **Document any issues** encountered for future reference

The migration is progressing well with 61% completion. The foundation is solid with all core systems (state, auth, routing, i18n) working properly. The remaining work is primarily component-level migrations and final integration testing.

## Quick Start Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /home/kseniia/IdeaProjects/ai-assistant-ui-new

# Install dependencies (if needed)
cd packages/web && npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build project (to test)
npm run build-only

# Check current task status
# Continue with Monaco Editor migration in utils/editorUtils.ts
```

## Key Migration Patterns Established

- **Vue Composition API ‚Üí React Hooks**: `ref()` ‚Üí `useState()`, `computed()` ‚Üí `useMemo()`
- **Vue Stores ‚Üí Zustand**: Maintained same interface, converted to Zustand patterns
- **Element Plus ‚Üí Ant Design**: Successful component mapping established
- **Vue Router ‚Üí React Router**: Nested routes with layout wrappers
- **vue-i18n ‚Üí react-i18next**: API-based translation loading maintained

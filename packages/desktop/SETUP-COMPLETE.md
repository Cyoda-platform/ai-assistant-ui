# ✅ Electron Application Setup for macOS Completed

## 🎯 What Was Done

### 1. Flexible Signing System
- ✅ Signing controlled by `ENABLE_CODE_SIGNING` variable
- ✅ By default creates unsigned builds (no Apple Developer Account required)
- ✅ Option for local signing when certificate is available
- ✅ Automatic fallback to adhoc signing

### 2. Build Scripts
- ✅ `yarn make:signed` - Build with code signing (requires certificate)
- ✅ `yarn make:unsigned` - Build without code signing (default)
- ✅ `yarn allow-unsigned` - Remove quarantine from built application

### 3. Installation Scripts
- ✅ `./scripts/create-dev-certificate.sh` - Create self-signed certificate
- ✅ `./scripts/allow-unsigned-app.sh` - Remove quarantine from applications
- ✅ `./scripts/install-macos.sh` - Comprehensive installation automation

### 4. CI/CD Integration
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow updated for unsigned builds
- ✅ Automatic quarantine removal during CI
- ✅ Multi-platform support (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
- ✅ Artifact preparation for distribution

### 5. Security Configuration
- ✅ Entitlements properly configured in `entitlements.mac.plist`
- ✅ Hardened runtime settings
- ✅ Network access permissions
- ✅ Microphone/camera access (if needed)

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Development (Recommended)
```bash
cd packages/desktop
yarn install
yarn make:unsigned
./scripts/install-macos.sh
```

### For Production with Certificate
```bash
cd packages/desktop
export ENABLE_CODE_SIGNING=true
yarn make:signed
```

### For CI/CD
The workflow automatically builds unsigned applications and prepares them for distribution.

## 📋 What Users Need to Do

### First-time Setup
1. Download the application (DMG or ZIP)
2. Run installation script OR manually approve the application
3. Application runs normally thereafter

### Manual Approval (if needed)
1. Try to open the application
2. See security warning
3. Go to **System Preferences → Security & Privacy**
4. Click **"Open Anyway"**

## 🎯 Benefits

### ✅ No Apple Developer Account Required
- Save $99/year for individual developers
- No certificate management complexity
- Perfect for internal distribution

### ✅ Flexible Development
- Switch between signed/unsigned builds easily
- Local certificate creation for testing
- Automated security configuration

### ✅ User-Friendly Distribution
- Installation scripts handle all security setup
- Clear documentation for end users
- One-time approval process

### ✅ CI/CD Ready
- Automated builds without certificate requirements
- Cross-platform support
- Artifact preparation for releases

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Code Signing Strategy
- **Unsigned builds**: Use adhoc signature (no external certificate)
- **Signed builds**: Use Apple Developer certificate when available
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation to unsigned if certificate missing

### Security Approach
- Applications are properly signed (adhoc signature)
- File integrity is maintained
- macOS security scanning still works
- User has control over application approval

### Distribution Method
- DMG files for easy installation
- ZIP archives for direct application access
- Installation scripts for automated setup
- Clear documentation for manual processes

## 📚 Documentation

- `README-SIGNING.md` - Complete signing guide
- `DISTRIBUTION-FAQ.md` - Distribution questions and answers
- Shell scripts with inline documentation
- Configuration files with detailed comments

## 🎉 Result

Your Electron application now:
- ✅ Builds successfully on any macOS system
- ✅ Runs on any Mac with minimal user interaction
- ✅ Distributes easily without certificate complexity
- ✅ Maintains security best practices
- ✅ Supports both development and production workflows

**Perfect solution for development teams and internal distribution!**
